# Hold The Flag Challenge - 7 points #

The team who is the LAST to "Hold Their Team Flag" image when the time runs out is the winner.
You need to upload your team flag image to the images folder and then edit the img src in index.html.

### How the winner is determined? ###

When the time runs out, I will pull this branch to my local pc. 
The team, whose flag I see there, is the winner. 

### What if there is no flag or image doesn't show up correctly? ###

Nobody gets points.
