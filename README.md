# Welcome To Bonus Challenge #

This repository allows all teams a chance to earn extra points, 20 in total.
If you can see a timer on the projector, it means that this bonus round has a limited
time to earn points.

## How to earn points?

This repository contains multiple branches, each one corresponding to a single challenge. 
Further instructions are within each branch documentation.

### Sabotaging

You can try to win time & sabotage another team in any creative way you know, except physical.
If in the end, the task is not considered completed by any team, nobody will receive points.
